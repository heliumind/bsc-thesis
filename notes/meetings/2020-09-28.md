# Progress

- Successfully compiled NCS_framework_cpp on Windows
- Ran thesis scenario until FH9 on Windows and Ubuntu, Mac only until FH7
- Performed sanity check on random number generator with 1 million samples → not the reason behind different performances
- Finished writing until Chapter 3 Scenario & Problem Formulation

# Next steps

- Add network share plot
- Look for real life GE channel parametrization

# Thesis advice

- Not too many simulation scenarios (varying GE channel)
    - Consider one main scenario
    - ~2 additional (other burstiness, real life GE channel)
- Additional Chapter for OS Performance (Effect of operating systems on simulation results)
    - Including enough information to be able to reproduce the issue (compiler, os)
- Send precorrected draft to Onur for proofreading and feedback at least one week before
- Presentations are always on Tuesdays →schedule beforehand with Onur

# Action Items

- [x]  Choose GE model parametrizations
- [x]  Network share plots
