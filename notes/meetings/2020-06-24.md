# Progress

- Finished implementing a gilbertelliot class which yields channel state and respective loss probability
- Master application: *7. December* is deadline for enrollment → Presentation, correcting, has to be finsished, so EI Faculty can forward my degree to enrollment office
- Finished GE aware FH scheduler
- Issue simulation code only one plant
- Markov Decision Process

# Problems

- How unrealistic is FH scheduler can  determine which state network is in
    - → Assuming scheduler can measure instantaneous loss probability, define a threshold value for which the channel state can be determined
    - implicitly I know from a loss probability change that channel state has changed → change accordingly
- Channel state should only be a single state variable not N times → This is wrong every user has their own channel state → state is appended by N additional variables resembling each users channel state (e.g. one is behind a wall)
- **2 options** : Either use state probability or transition probability → use transition probability
    - The sojourn times (mean sojourn time / mean wating time) can maybe used in an offline scheduling scheme

# Next steps

- Check issue with single plant
- Check complexity in constructing tree
    - By setting sampling period = 1, worst case
    - Check formula
- Simulate over varying horizons to get a trend
- Paper about loss probability, AoI distribution
    - given the average loss probability of a link the paper introduces a method to derive AoI distribution
    - *difference* to our scenario: the link is scheduled constantly (not a scheduled case) → distribution will be shifted (to the right)
    - AoI histogramm is a nice measurement to include in paper

    → Comparison is the key here

    with the info with how often we scheduled the loop we can maybe get the distribution

## MAC issue

Former simulations conducted on ubuntu and mac ⇒ Mac shows weird behaviour

- In observing the trend of MSE AoI with growing windows sizes, the trend on mac was not as smooth
- shifted down by 20% → not negligable
- more fluctuating

# Action Items

- [x]  Request simulation server access
