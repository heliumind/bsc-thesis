# Progress

- Added A135 to simulation and performing simulations to investigate scheduler performance after a specific horizon size
    - Also with more challenging sub-system, we cannot observe a noticeable performance gain → channel still too random?
    - Problem: Simulating with high transition probabilities, because only simulation until FH10 is feasible. But this makes the channel more random and the errors less bursty

# Problems

- AoI Hist plots, including or excluding the paper distribution → I would exclude and in an discussion reference the according paper, saying the scenario fits to one certain plot
    - Change Frequency to Count, and absolute
    - Include paper distribution only for A100_WC
- GE aware scheduling starting from FH5 is not feasible → takes too long
    - Applications too demanding → either reduce system complexity, make channel better, increase sampling period

# Next steps

- Uniform and Normal distribution form (0,1) in 100 bins: histogram
    - only reasons can be randomness, or matrix multiplication  → rounding errors (difference in floating point operations)
- Eigen dependency, if not strawberry
- In thesis evaluation:
    - AoI Hist
    - Investigation GE channel on Onur's scheduler
    - Comparison Onur's scheduler and my GE aware scheduler
        - include table comparing complexity with tree size
    - Investigation Performance Mac, windows, linux

# Action Items

- [x]  Write cpp program generating realizations from a uniform and normal distribution
- [x]  Write python script generating density histograms comparing different OS
- [x]  Find suitable channel / scenario for fully GE aware scheduler
