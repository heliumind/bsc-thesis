# Progress

- Successfully converted QT Project to a CMake project
- AoI histogram plotted for A100 100sec simulation
    - AoI of 1 is much higher → paper assumes sampling period of 1, I simulated with sampling period of 3

# Problems

- Use of c++17 <filesystem> library a bottleneck in building, as minimum compiler versions are required and building options are necessary for each compiler respectively → Trying to cope with CMake script → Tested on macOS 10.15 Catalina with AppleClang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.12) and Ubuntu 18.04:
    - For gcc minimum is gcc8 but *-lstdc++fs* link option has to be set → starting with gcc9 not anymore as fs is part of stdc++ library
- Two different ways of implementing GE channel model
    - Intuitive implementation:
        - Simulation of a single has +5% with long simulation time, shorter simulation time fluctuates more and goes to the expected average loss probability
        - but simulation of >2 loops result in expected average loss prob →
        - Yields expected average coherence time results. Example trace (0: GOOD, 1: BAD)

        ```cpp

    - Probability iteration:
        - Simulation with long simulation time, result in expected average loss prob
        - But heavy alternating coherence times, showing almost non Markovian behavior

- (~ 14:56) Onur has a Python script for given average loss probability, can give me optimal scheduling policies for infinite horizon. Scenario: constant channel every user has fixed loss probability for every user. Onur applied that scheduler in the dynamic scenario, this scheduler performs worse than FH scheduler (suboptimal compared to alternative one).
- Approach for scheduler decrease Horizon with time:
    - Example Coherence Time is 10, we start with Horizon 10 old scheduler
    - Every time the scheduler notices a change in channel state identified by change in loss probability, it resets Horizon to 10
    - making approximation to gain complexity → as we proceed in time the number of horizon we need to check decreases significantly, the remaining expected coherence time → reduce complexity, more feasable
    - Statistically does not make sense because  process should be memoryless, but maybe we gain gain performance
- How to measure scheduler performance? Same scenario plot stats

# Next steps

- Testing CMake building on Windows
- On a windows machine as it is, to see the FH vs. MSE graph
- Add more logs to investigate the difference between OS X and Ubuntu. (probably random number generator)
- Verify coherence time and average loss
- expect lower schedcounter

# Action Items

- [x]  Merge cmake with master
