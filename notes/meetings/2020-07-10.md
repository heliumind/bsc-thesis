# Progress

- Finished implementing GE aware scheduler
- Running simulations
- Prepared Kick Off presentation

# Problems

- Running simulations starting from H = 3 is slow
- Complexity includes $(2^N(N+1))^{H+1}$ ⇒ GE aware scheduler is not *scalable*
    - Go back one step and simulate only with GE channel model but without GE aware scheduler
- Changing GE parameters to symmetrical transition probabilities → More realistic simulation (research on why?)
    - Results in on average 50% of the time channel is in GOOD and 50% in BAD state respectively
- Mean sojourn time is inversely proportional to channel state transition probability → controls average coherence time
    - Use this relation in simulation model to set the real coherence time, because status quo is hard coded
    - Do measurements regarding coherence time and compare with computed value
- Using simulation behavior of GE, how scheduler behaves (MSE, AoI) with varying coherence times → a lead to adjust Horizon size (similar to have paper derives a performance stop at H=5)
- Being GE aware does not necessarily mean knowing all transition probabilities but also just the average coherence time
- We cannot be fully GE aware because it is not scalable, we fail already in the third horizon
- Come around this by coming up with a tradeoff
- ⇒ New **Investigation**

# Next steps

- Try to make the full GE tree scalable

# Action Items

- [x]  Changing GE parameters to symmetrical transition probabilities → Why?
