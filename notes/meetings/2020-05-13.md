- From the moment I officially start I have up to 5 month to deliver thesis and defense → Early submission is fine
- Writing will take longer than I expect since I am doing it the first time → Onur suggests up to 3-4 weeks only for writing
- **State of the art** is given with Onur's paper, maybe check for related work
- Codebase is very large, I will only need to modify 1-2 files for Gilbert-Elliot model

    → More states will be necessary i.e. which state the channel is at
