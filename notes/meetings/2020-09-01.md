# Progress

### AoI Histogram

- How I measure AoI: Either every slot from controller or every sampling period from controller; makes no difference
    - Every ms I measure AoI → maybe that is why it performs this well
- AoIHist plot updated (50s ): 2 scenarios A100 and A100, A125, A150, sampling period 3 and 1 respectively
Paper AoI distribution had to shifted to the right because it allows AoI = 0, but in our simulation AoI ≥ 1 → shifted to the right
    - A100: WC fits data, longer sampling period has significantly more 1 AoI → expected because failed transmissions can be recovered within sampling period
    - 3N: WC much lower than expected, 3 sampling period behaves like expected
    - Paper assumes sampling period = 1?

### Coherence Time

- Verified mapping of (symmetric) transition probability to average coherence time → using it in scheduling
    - Average Coherence Time is mapped to $\frac{1}{p_{transition}}$
    - Statistical properties confirm coherence time is an geometrically distributed random variable

# Problems

### Average loss probability bug

- average loss dependent of systems sampling period: the higher the bigger the +% is
- Metrics are correctly calculated because other scenarios result expected behavior

# Next steps

- Compare MSE plots with FH scheduler and GE behavior on mac and linux
- Determine average loss probability with old TruncatedNormalDistribution channel between mac and linux
- Compare old scenario but fully aware GE scheduler and channel model up to FH10
    - Onur for simulation server
