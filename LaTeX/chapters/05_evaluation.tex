\chapter{Evaluation}

In this chapter, we present a simulative analysis and compare our proposed
extended scheduler to its base scheduler. In Section~(\ref{sec:setup}) three .We further provide 

\section{Simulation Setup} \label{sec:setup}
Details regarding implementation and/or simulation are given in this chapter.
The considered setup and the parameters used are introduced and discussed. Also,
the general evaluation methods can be presented. (Note: Code should not be part
of this chapter. If it makes sense to introduce it into the thesis, it should be
placed in the appendix.)

\section{Results and Discussion}
Results of the performed investigations are presented here. Interpretations for
the observed effects are given and the impact of investigations is discussed.
