\chapter{Background}

In this chapter, all background necessary to understand the thesis are
introduced. The level of detail is such that a colleague with similar background
(no specialist!) is capable of understanding the contribution and impact of the
thesis. A discussion of state-of-the-art solutions (e.g. literature research) is
often helpful. Problems of the state-of-the-art are typically discussed and the
contribution of the thesis is introduced in detail. 

In this chapter, we first present related work on scheduling in NCS scenarios in
Sec. \ref{sec:survey}. Afterwards, we give a short introduction to the
Gilbert-Elliot channel model in Sec. \ref{sec:GE} and introduce the Dynammic
Programming algorthm for stochastic optimization in Sec. \ref{sec:DP}.
