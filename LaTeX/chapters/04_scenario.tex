\chapter{Scenario and Problem Statement}

Suppose $N$ independent, linear time-invariant (LTI) control systems sharing a
wirless communication network. Each individual subsytem $i$ consists of a plant
$\plant$, a sensor $\sensor$, and a controller $\controller$ with an estimator
$\estimator$. Each sensor $\sensor$ samples the plant periodically and transmits
the latest state information to $\controller$. On the controller side,
$\estimator$ estimates periodically the current plant state based on the latest
received information. Estimated state is then used by $\controller$ to calculate
the next control input. We assume each controller-plant pair to be co-located
and hence connected through an ideal link while the sensor is operating remotely
over the shared wirless channel as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:scenario}.

Sensor-to-contoller link is closed over a shared wireless channel. Medium access is granted centrally by a scheduler. Note that $k_i$ refers to the sampling period a sub-system $i$ is.}

\section{Network Model}
Time is divided into slots which is also the smallest time unit in our scenario.
We use $t \in \mathbb{N}$ All transmissions are managed by a centralized entity
called \textit{scheduler}.
