\section*{Abstract}
Many emerging applications to be supported by upcoming 5G networks can be seen
as Networked Control Systems (NCS), i.e., feedback control loops closed over a
communication network. Delay, limited network resources, time-varying channel
conditions are common network-induced challenges which can be tackled by a
scheduler granting medium access efficiently. Age-of-Information (AoI) is a
recently introduced network metric quantifying information freshness at a
receiving network node and is meant to serve as an interface between
communication network and application. In this work, we employ AoI to calculate
penalty functions used to derive an optimal control-aware scheduling strategy.
We consider a single wireless link shared by multiple, heterogeneous NCS where
channel behavior are governed by the Gilbert-Elliot model. We show by
simulations that our proposed scheduling algorithm provides improved quality of
control but is not scalable due to high computational cost. Furthermore, we have
investigated possible reasons behind varying simulation results when performed
on different operating systems.
